# UFOs

**Overview of Project**

    The purpose of this analysis was to improve Dana’s webpage and dynamic table by allowing users to 
    filter for the city, state, country, and shape.
**Results**

    The new and improved webpage now allow users to filter for the city, state, country, and shape. 
    Simply type in the desired criteria and the table will automatically pull up records matching 
    user input. The figure down below demonstrates this.

**Summary**

    The one drawback I see in this design is the lack of a button. The table automatically pulls in
    records based on user input. However, this could prove problematic for the user’s who are not 
    too tech savvy. I would recommend adding a filter button for the user to click once the 
    desired criteria has been inputted. Furthermore I would also scrape more websites to gather more 
    up to date information regarding the latest sightings.
